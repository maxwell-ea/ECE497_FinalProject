class Microbial(GeneticAlgorithm):
    """ A Microbial Genetic Algorithm using Localized Tournament Selection, child class of GeneticAlgorithm.

        Algorithm Methodology:
            1. Choose at random two individuals from the same deme (local "neighborhood")
            2. Compare the fitness of the individuals, and assign one winner and one loser
            3. Infect the loser with some proportion of the winner\'s genes
            4. With some probability, mutate the loser through a random bit flip

        For inherited attributes and methods, refer to the GeneticAlgorithm class documentation.

        Attributes
        ----------
        deme_size : int
            The size of the local neighborhood (or deme) from which the second parent is chosen

        Methods
        -------
        select(verbosity=0)
            Chooses at random two individuals from the same deme (local "neighborhood")
        reproduce(index1, index2, verbosity=0)
            Takes indices of two individuals in the population, assigns a winner and loser based on fitness, and infects
            each of the loser\'s genes with the winner\'s with probability self.prob_reproduction
        mutate(index, verbosity=0)
            With some probability self.prob_mutation, a random bit will be flipped for the individual in the
            population at the given index
        cycle(verbosity=0)
            Completes one generational cycle of selection, reproduction, and mutation then returns the new population
            and the list of what member of the population was infected/replaced

        Parameters
        ----------
        self.deme_size : int
            The deme size will be defined as the number of individuals *on each side* of the first parent chosen
            in selection included in the deme (local "neighborhood") for that parent. (Ex. for a population size of
            11, a deme of 5 would include the entire population.) If the deme is not passed in, or it would include
            the entire population, it is set to zero

        self.mutation_deviation : float
            Only used for a real-valued encoding. This is the percentage of the current value that is added or subtracted
            during a mutation. [Ex. if mutation_deviation = 0.01, then when that gene is mutated it becomes:
            gene += 0.01 * gene (* +- 1)]

        self.encoding_type : int
            If encoding_type = 0, then the encoding is in binary, so mutation is a bit flip
            If encoding_type = 1, then the encoding is a real-valued number, so mutation is +- some percentage of the
            current value
